A complete end-to-end system that combines computer vision and physical automation to detect, classify, and sort objects on conveyor belts. The system uses deep learning for object classification, sends commands to an Arduino-controlled dual conveyor belt system, and features a fully interactive GUI for real-time monitoring and control.

## üîç Overview

This project integrates computer vision with physical automation to create an intelligent object sorting system. Objects are detected using a camera and a TensorFlow/Keras deep learning model, then sorted into corresponding bins by a dual conveyor belt system controlled by Arduino. The entire process is orchestrated by a Python application with a user-friendly GUI.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Object Detection (Python)**: Uses TensorFlow/Keras to classify objects via camera.
2. **Control System (Python)**: Processes detections and communicates with Arduino.
3. **Conveyor Controller (Arduino)**: Controls motors and sensors for physical sorting.

## üîç Technical Details

### ‚öôÔ∏è Arduino State Machine

The Arduino code implements two state machines:

1. **Conveyor 1 State Machine**:
   - `C1_IDLE`: Waiting for objects
   - `C1_RUNNING`: Moving object toward exit
   - `C1_WAIT_DROP`: Object at exit, waiting for correct box
   - `C1_DROPPING`: Dropping object into box

2. **Conveyor 2 State Machine**:
   - `C2_IDLE`: Waiting for objects on conveyor 1
   - `C2_FINDING_BOX`: Looking for the right color box
   - `C2_POSITIONING`: Fine-tuning box position
   - `C2_READY`: Ready for object drop

### üîÑ Queue Implementation

The Arduino system maintains a color queue:
- Colors are enqueued when received from Python
- Objects are processed FIFO (First In, First Out)
- Queue ensures colors don't exceed object count
- Default to BLUE if queue is empty

### üì° Communication Protocol

**Python to Arduino Commands**:
- `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`: Add BLUE, BLACK, RED, or YELLOW color to queue
- `STOP`: Stop all conveyor movement
- `SLOW`: Activate slow movement mode
- `NORMAL`: Set normal movement speed
- `RESET`: Reset system state
- `STATUS`: Request system status
- `DIR_LEFT`/`DIR_RIGHT`: Control conveyor 2 direction

**Arduino to Python Messages**:
- `NEW_OBJECT_DETECTED`: Signals a new object at entry
- `Color Reading - R: X, G: Y, B: Z`: Raw color sensor data
- `Detected: COLOR`: Color sensor classification
- `Drop complete. Color: COLOR`: Successful object sort

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Arduino Issues
- **No "READY" message**: Check power and USB connections
- **Unresponsive motors**: Verify wiring and motor driver connections
- **Incorrect color detection**: Adjust color thresholds in Arduino code
- **Objects not dropping**: Check alignment between conveyors

### Common Python Issues
- **Camera not found**: Verify camera index and availability
- **Model not loading**: Ensure `interactive_model.h5` and `class_names.json` exist
- **Serial connection failures**: Check COM port and ensure Arduino is connected
- **GUI not responding**: Check for error messages in console

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- **Multiple Object Tracking**: Handle multiple objects on the belt simultaneously
- **Web Interface**: Remote monitoring and control via browser
- **Data Analytics**: Track sorting statistics and performance metrics
- **Dynamic Color Learning**: Automatic calibration of color thresholds
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery from jam or misclassification events
- **Energy Optimization**: Intelligent power management for motors
